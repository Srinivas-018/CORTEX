### 🎯 Evidence Types Supported
- Call logs and SMS messages
- Messaging apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Facebook Messenger)
- Contacts and address books
- GPS location data and maps
- Browser history (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Photos and videos with EXIF metadata
- Deleted and hidden data recovery
- Application databases

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- pip package manager
- **System packages for pytsk3** (for file system analysis):
  - **Debian/Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install libtsk-dev`
  - **macOS**: `brew install sleuthkit`
  - **Windows**: Visual C++ Build Tools (from Visual Studio)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Srinivas-018/CORTEX.git
cd CORTEX
```

2. Install system dependencies (Linux/macOS):
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libtsk-dev

# macOS
brew install sleuthkit
```

3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:5000`

### Docker Setup (Optional)

For containerized deployment, use a Debian-based image with pytsk3 support:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Install system dependencies for pytsk3
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y libtsk-dev && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy application files
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

# Expose Streamlit port
EXPOSE 8501

# Run the application
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t cortex-forensics .
docker run -p 8501:8501 cortex-forensics
```

## Usage

### 1. Create a Case
- Start by creating a new forensic case on the dashboard
- Enter Case ID, name, investigator details, and device information

### 2. Upload Device Image
- Navigate to the "Image Input" tab
- Upload a mobile device image file (.img, .bin, .dd, etc.)
- System automatically calculates SHA-256 hash for integrity verification

### 3. Extract Data
- Use the "Data Extraction" tab to extract various artifacts:
  - Call logs and SMS messages
  - Messaging app data (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.)
  - Contacts
  - Location history
  - Browser history
  - Deleted files

### 4. Analyze Evidence
- Use "Analysis Tools" to:
  - Build chronological timelines
  - Search for keywords across all data
  - View case statistics

### 5. Visualize Findings
- View interactive charts and graphs
- Display location data on maps
- Analyze communication networks

### 6. Generate Reports
- Create professional PDF forensic reports
- Include executive summary, evidence inventory, chain of custody
- Export timeline and data in CSV format
