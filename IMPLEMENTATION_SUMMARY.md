# S3 Multipart Upload Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds support for uploading files up to 1 TB to AWS S3 using multipart uploads with presigned URLs. The solution bypasses the Streamlit server entirely, uploading files directly from the browser to S3.

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐         ┌─────────┐
│   Browser   │ ──────> │   FastAPI    │ ──────> │   S3    │
│  (Streamlit)│ <────── │   Backend    │         │ Bucket  │
└─────────────┘         └──────────────┘         └─────────┘
      │                                                ↑
      │         Direct Upload via Presigned URLs      │
      └────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. User selects file in Streamlit UI
2. Streamlit requests presigned URLs from FastAPI
3. FastAPI generates presigned URLs using boto3
4. Browser uploads parts directly to S3
5. Browser sends completion request to FastAPI
6. FastAPI finalizes multipart upload
7. Streamlit verifies object exists in S3

## Performance Characteristics

### File Size Handling
| File Size | Part Size | Part Count | Upload Time (est.) |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------------|
| 100 MB    | 5 MB      | 20 parts   | ~1 min @ 10 MB/s   |
| 1 GB      | 5 MB      | 205 parts  | ~2 min @ 10 MB/s   |
| 100 GB    | 10.24 MB  | 10,000     | ~3 hours @ 10 MB/s |
| 1 TB      | 104.86 MB | 10,000     | ~30 hours @ 10 MB/s|

### Concurrency
- Default: 4 concurrent part uploads
- Configurable in HTML component
- Balances speed vs. bandwidth usage

### Resource Usage
- Minimal server memory (no file buffering)
- No disk I/O on Streamlit server
- FastAPI backend: ~50-100 MB RAM per instance
- Browser: ~10-50 MB per upload session

## Cost Estimation (AWS S3)

### 1 TB File Upload
- Upload cost: ~$0.05 (PUT requests)
- Storage cost: ~$23.55/month (Standard tier)
- Download cost: ~$92.16 (if downloaded once)

### Ongoing Costs
- S3 storage: $0.023/GB/month
- Data transfer out: $0.09/GB
- PUT requests: $0.005/1,000 requests
- Lifecycle operations: Free

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Resume capability for interrupted uploads
- Multi-file batch uploads
- S3 Transfer Acceleration support
- Upload scheduling and queuing
- Email notifications on completion
- Integration with forensic case workflow
- Automatic hash calculation and verification
- Metadata extraction during upload
- Compression before upload option

### Monitoring Enhancements
- CloudWatch metrics integration
- Upload success/failure dashboard
- Cost tracking per upload
- Performance analytics
- User activity logging

## Known Limitations

1. **Browser limitations**: Very large files may cause browser memory issues
2. **Network interruptions**: No automatic resume (requires manual restart)
3. **Concurrent uploads**: Limited to one upload per browser session
4. **Part size**: Fixed after upload starts (can't be changed mid-upload)
5. **AWS credentials**: Must be pre-configured (no UI for credential management)

## Compliance & Best Practices

✅ Presigned URLs with expiration
✅ CORS configuration documented
✅ IAM least-privilege policies
